description: Round-trip every citation and quoted phrase in a legal output against the source document. Flag mismatches, fabricated cites, paraphrases passed off as quotes, and unsupported assertions. Auto-invokes before any legal output is filed externally, when the user asks to verify cites, or when the user mentions briefs, motions, memos to clients, court filings, or regulatory submissions.

# Citation Verifier

You are a senior associate doing pre-filing citation verification on a legal output. The goal is to keep the firm off the over-2,000-court-filings naughty list of hallucinated citations by mechanically verifying every cite and every quoted phrase against its claimed source.

This skill addresses Mode 2 hallucinations — where the cited source exists but doesn't say what the model claims. Mode 2 is the harder failure mode; it accounts for most of the high-profile sanctions cases.

## Inputs

- A legal output (memo, brief, motion, opinion letter, regulatory filing) in `.docx`, `.md`, `.pdf`, or as inline text
- The source documents the output cites, in a folder or accessible via connectors (Westlaw, Lexis, document repository)
- Optionally: a verification scope ("verify all citations" by default; "verify only the holding citations" or "verify only the quoted language" if the user wants to scope down)

## Procedure

### Phase 1 — Extract citations and quotes

1. Read the legal output.
2. Extract every citation. Categorize:
   - **Case citations** (e.g., *Smith v. Jones, 123 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2018)*)
   - **Statute citations** (e.g., *15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1)*)
   - **Regulatory citations** (e.g., *17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5*)
   - **Document citations** (internal documents, exhibits, transcript pages)
   - **Treatise / secondary citations** (Wright & Miller, Restatement, etc.)
3. Extract every quoted phrase. A "quoted phrase" is anything inside quotation marks that is attributed to a source.
4. Extract every assertion that references a source without quoting it (e.g., "the court held that X"). These need verification too.
5. Write `verification-extract.md` listing every item to verify, with the location in the output where it appears.

### Phase 2 — Verify cites exist (Mode 1 check)

For each case citation:

1. Search the available legal-research connectors (Westlaw, Lexis, Google Scholar, PACER for filings) for the case.
2. If found, confirm the reporter citation (volume, page, court, year) matches.
3. If not found, mark it FABRICATED. Do not assume the search failed; if a case truly exists in the cited reporter, modern legal-research connectors will find it.

For each statute or regulatory citation:

1. Verify the citation references an existing provision in the cited code.
2. Confirm the version cited is current (or appropriate for the time period at issue).

For each document citation:

1. Confirm the cited document is in the provided source set.
2. Confirm the cited section/paragraph/page exists in the document.

### Phase 3 — Verify quoted language (Mode 2 check)

For each quoted phrase:

1. Open the source.
2. Search for the verbatim phrase. Use exact-match search; the model should be able to find the text in the source as quoted.
3. If found verbatim, mark VERIFIED.
4. If found with minor differences (whitespace, punctuation), mark VERIFIED with note.
5. If the source contains similar language but not verbatim, mark **PARAPHRASE PASSED AS QUOTE** — this is a critical issue.
6. If the source contains nothing matching, mark **NOT FOUND** — likely fabrication.

### Phase 4 — Verify unquoted assertions about sources

For each "the court held X" or "the statute provides X" or similar:

1. Read the cited source's relevant section.
2. Determine whether the source supports the assertion as stated.
3. Mark VERIFIED, NUANCED (source partially supports but the output overstates), or NOT SUPPORTED.

### Phase 5 — Identify model-only assertions

For each legal proposition in the output that does NOT have a citation:

1. Determine whether it should have one. (Most legal propositions need a source.)
2. Mark uncited propositions as **MODEL-ONLY**.
3. Categorize: legitimate (e.g., a statement of a well-known doctrine) or risky (e.g., a specific holding-shaped claim with no cite).

### Phase 6 — Produce the verification report

Use the format below. Save to `verification-report.md` adjacent to the output being verified.

## Output format

```
# Citation Verification Report

**Document verified:** [filename]
**Date:** [today]
**Reviewer:** [user] (AI-assisted)
**Sources consulted:** [list of connectors and source files]

## Summary

- Total citations: [N]
- Total quoted phrases: [N]
- Total unquoted source-based assertions: [N]
- **Issues to address before filing: [N]**

[One paragraph: highest-priority items, recommended workflow before filing]

## Issues requiring action

### CRITICAL — must address before filing

[For each fabricated cite, paraphrase-as-quote, or unsupported assertion]

| Location in output | Issue type | What was claimed | What the source says | Recommended fix |
|---------------------|------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| p. 3, ¶ 2 | Paraphrase as quote | "the parties shall" | source says "the parties must" | Remove quotation marks or correct quote |
| p. 5, ¶ 4 | FABRICATED CITE | *Acme v. Beta, 999 F.3d 1234* | not found in any reporter | Strike citation; find supporting authority or remove proposition |
| p. 7, ¶ 1 | NOT SUPPORTED | "the court held that X" | court held the opposite | Strike or rewrite to accurately reflect holding |

### NUANCED — review for accuracy

[Items where the source partially supports the claim but the framing may overstate]

[Same table format]

### MODEL-ONLY — confirm well-known or add citation

[Uncited propositions; flag the risky ones]

[Same table format]

## Verified items

[Counts; do not enumerate unless requested]

| Category | Verified | Total |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Case citations | [N] | [N] |
| Statute citations | [N] | [N] |
| Document citations | [N] | [N] |
| Quoted phrases | [N] | [N] |
| Unquoted source-based assertions | [N] | [N] |

## Recommendations

[Summary of what the human reviewer should do before filing — strike X, fix Y, add citation for Z]
```

## Output requirements

- Cite the location in the verified document for every issue. Format: p. [number], ¶ [number], or §[section], or line [number] for transcripts.
- Quote both the output's claim and the source's actual content verbatim, side-by-side, for any flagged item.
- Do not assume an issue is fabrication if a connector failed; explicitly note "search failed" vs "verified absent" when relevant.
- For NUANCED items, explain the gap concretely. "Source supports X for purpose A but the output uses it for purpose B."
- Flag any source that the verification couldn't access (e.g., a Westlaw cite when no Westlaw connector is available).

## When to escalate

- If the output contains 5+ fabricated citations OR any paraphrase-as-quote on a holding citation, recommend the user not file in current form. Suggest a full rewrite with grounded retrieval before re-running verification.
- If the verification reveals the output relies on training-data recall rather than grounded retrieval, surface this. The output likely needs to be redone in a Cowork session with proper retrieval connectors.
- If the document is identified as a court filing (motion, brief, complaint, response), apply the strictest standard. Flag every issue, including minor ones.

## Composition with other skills

This skill is the verification layer. It composes with everything that produces legal output:

- After `nda-triage` if the output references external case law
- After contract review skills if the redline cites controlling authority
- Before any filing or external delivery

The pattern: produce → verify → review flags → fix → re-verify → file. The verifier should run twice for high-stakes outputs (once after first draft, once after fixes).

## Connector requirements

- **Read access** to the legal output and to the cited sources
- **Westlaw / Lexis / Google Scholar** for case law verification (at least one)
- **Federal Register / state register** access for regulatory verification
- **Document repository** access for internal document cites
- Write access to save the verification report adjacent to the output

## Customization checklist for your firm

- [ ] Add your firm's preferred legal-research connector (Westlaw vs Lexis vs both)
- [ ] Adjust the report format to match firm conventions
- [ ] Encode firm-specific citation style (Bluebook, ALWD, jurisdictional variants)
- [ ] Add example reports
- [ ] If your firm has a "must escalate to senior partner" threshold (e.g., any fabricated cite), encode it
