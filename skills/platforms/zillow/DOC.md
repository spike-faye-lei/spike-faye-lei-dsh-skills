# Zillow

## Overview
Real estate marketplace. Search properties, get full property details, Zestimates, and neighborhood data.

## Workflows

### Search properties in a city
1. `searchProperties(mapBounds, regionSelection, filterState)` → property listings with zpid

### Get full details for a property
1. `searchProperties(...)` → get `zpid` from results
2. `getPropertyDetail(zpid)` → address, price, beds, baths, sqft, photos, description, Zestimate

### Check home value estimate
1. `getZestimate(zpid)` → current Zestimate, rent estimate, confidence range, history

### Research a neighborhood
1. `getNeighborhood(zpid)` → schools, walk/transit/bike scores, nearby comparable homes

## Operations

| Operation | Intent | Key Input | Key Output | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-----------|------------|-------|
| searchProperties | find properties for sale | mapBounds, regionSelection, filterState | listings: address, price, beds, baths, sqft, zestimate, photos, lat/lng | entry point, returns ~41 results |
| getPropertyDetail | get full property details | zpid, slug | address, price, beds, baths, sqft, photos, description, Zestimate, year built | adapter: __NEXT_DATA__ extraction |
| getZestimate | get home value estimate | zpid, slug | zestimate, rentZestimate, confidence range, tax assessment, history | adapter: __NEXT_DATA__ extraction |
| getNeighborhood | get neighborhood data | zpid, slug | schools, walkScore, transitScore, bikeScore, nearby homes | adapter: __NEXT_DATA__ extraction |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Search San Francisco (regionId 20330)
openweb zillow exec searchProperties '{"searchQueryState":{"pagination":{},"isMapVisible":true,"mapBounds":{"north":37.82,"south":37.70,"east":-122.35,"west":-122.52},"filterState":{"sortSelection":{"value":"globalrelevanceex"},"isAllHomes":{"value":true}},"isListVisible":true,"regionSelection":[{"regionId":20330,"regionType":6}],"category":"cat1"},"wants":{"cat1":["listResults"]},"requestId":1}'

# Get property details by zpid
openweb zillow exec getPropertyDetail '{"zpid":"15076238","slug":"1000-Fell-St-San-Francisco-CA-94117"}'

# Get Zestimate for a property
openweb zillow exec getZestimate '{"zpid":"15076238","slug":"1000-Fell-St-San-Francisco-CA-94117"}'

# Get neighborhood data
openweb zillow exec getNeighborhood '{"zpid":"15076238","slug":"1000-Fell-St-San-Francisco-CA-94117"}'
```

## Site Internals

### API Architecture
- Next.js SSR app with GraphQL API at `/graphql` using Apollo persisted queries
- `gdpClientCache` in `__NEXT_DATA__` contains the same data as the GraphQL response (118+ fields)
- Search results available in `searchPageState.cat1` within `__NEXT_DATA__`

### Auth
- `cookie_session` — PerimeterX requires a valid browser session; all endpoints return 403 without one
- No login required for public property data (`requires_auth: false`)

### Transport
- `page` for all 4 ops (PerimeterX blocks all programmatic API calls — only full page navigation works)
- **Hybrid**: 3 of 4 ops (`getPropertyDetail`, `getZestimate`, `getNeighborhood`) use spec `x-openweb.extraction` (`page_global_data` reading `__NEXT_DATA__` → `gdpClientCache` → `value.property`). `searchProperties` stays on the thin `zillow-detail` adapter because it has to translate the `regionSelection.regionId` into a city slug (e.g. `20330 → san-francisco-ca`) before navigation, then read `searchPageState.cat1` from `__NEXT_DATA__`.
- Server-level `page_plan.warm: true` enables the runtime's generic PerimeterX retry path (about:blank → clearCookies → retry) for all ops, including the spec-extraction ones.
- **GraphQL API (`/graphql/`) is fully blocked by PerimeterX** — both `page.evaluate(fetch())` and `page.request.fetch()` return 403 with CAPTCHA HTML.

### Extraction
- `getPropertyDetail`, `getZestimate`, `getNeighborhood` → `page_global_data`: navigate `https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/{slug}/{zpid}_zpid/` → parse `script#__NEXT_DATA__` → walk `pageProps.componentProps.gdpClientCache` for `value.property` (118+ fields, projected per-op)
- `searchProperties` → adapter: regionId → known city slug → navigate region landing page → extract `searchPageState.cat1` from `__NEXT_DATA__`

### Adapter Patterns
- `searchProperties` — encodes a small `regionId → slug` table (SF, LA, NYC, Seattle, Chicago, Houston, Miami, Austin, Denver, Portland) and toggles `/rentals/` for `category: cat2`. Adapter also runs the explicit `navigateWithPxRetry` (about:blank + clearCookies, up to 4 attempts) and stale-page recovery in `init()`.
- The detail ops no longer need the adapter's manual PX retry — `page_plan.warm: true` lets the runtime perform the same about:blank/clearCookies cycle generically before the spec extraction runs.

### PerimeterX Handling (adapter pattern)
- Initial page load after browser start triggers CAPTCHA — verify warm-up poisons the PX session
- **Stale page recovery**: verify warm-up may trigger PX which closes the CDP tab. `adapter.init()` detects stale page errors (`Cannot find parent object`, `has been closed`, `Target closed`) and recovers by navigating to `about:blank` + clearing cookies
- **Reset pattern**: navigate to `about:blank` → `context.clearCookies()` → wait 1s → retry navigation
- `navigateWithPxRetry()` also handles stale page on first navigation attempt — detects the error, blanks + clears, and retries
- Up to 4 retry attempts per navigation; first 1-2 attempts typically CAPTCHA, subsequent succeed
- `propertyCache` avoids re-navigation when multiple ops target the same zpid

### Known Issues
- **PerimeterX**: Aggressive CAPTCHA on all requests including GraphQL API. The adapter handles retries automatically via the about:blank cookie reset pattern. Sessions degrade after ~10 minutes of inactivity.
- `walkScore`, `transitScore`, `bikeScore` return null — not in SSR initial data (lazy-loaded)
- `schools`, `nearbyHomes`, `taxHistory`, `description` may be null for some properties (not in initial SSR query)
- `regionId` is required for search but not easily discoverable — use known IDs
- `slug` parameter is cosmetic — use `"_"` if unknown, Zillow redirects to correct URL
