# LinkedIn

## Overview
Professional networking platform — social media archetype with Voyager REST/GraphQL API.

## Workflows

### Look up a person's profile
1. `getProfile(variables)` → profile data → `profileUrn`
2. `getProfileByUrn(id ← getProfile, decorationId)` → full profile with experience, education, skills

### Browse feed and news
1. `getFeed(variables)` → posts, articles, shares
2. `getNewsStorylines(variables)` → trending topics, curated news

### Search people, jobs, or content
1. `searchGeo(keywords)` → geo results → `geoId` (from `included[].entityUrn` suffix)
2. `searchJobs(keywords, geoId?, count?, start?)` → job cards → `jobId`
3. `getJobDetail(jobId ← searchJobs)` → full posting with description, requirements, salary

### Check connections and invitations
1. `getConnectionsSummary()` → total count, new connections
2. `getInvitations(q, count, start)` → pending invites with sender info
3. `getMyNetworkNotifications()` → connection suggestions

### Check notifications
1. `getNotificationCards(decorationId, q, count)` → likes, comments, mentions, job alerts
