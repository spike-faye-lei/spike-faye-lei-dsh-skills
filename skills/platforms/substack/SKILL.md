### Browse a publication's posts
1. `getArchive(subdomain)` → posts with `id`, `slug`
2. `getPost(subdomain, slug)` → full article with `id`, `title`, `body_html`
3. `getPostComments(subdomain, postId=id)` → discussion with `body`, `name`, `children`

### Search within a publication
1. `getArchive(subdomain, search="keyword")` → filtered posts with `slug`
2. `getPost(subdomain, slug)` → full article
