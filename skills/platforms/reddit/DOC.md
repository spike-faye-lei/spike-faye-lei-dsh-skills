# Reddit

## Overview
Social media platform — link aggregation, discussion, communities (subreddits). Social Media archetype.

## Workflows

### Browse and read a subreddit
1. `getSubredditPosts(subreddit)` → pick post → `post_id`, `subreddit`
2. `getPostComments(subreddit, post_id)` → post detail + comment tree

### Search and dive into a post
1. `searchPosts(q)` → results with `subreddit`, post `id`
2. `getPostComments(subreddit, post_id)` → full post + comments

### Investigate a user
1. `getUserProfile(username)` → karma, account age, verified status
2. `getUserPosts(username)` → recent posts and comments

### Create content
1. `createPost(sr, title, kind, text)` → creates a self or link post
2. `createComment(thing_id, text)` → replies to a post or comment

### Manage content
1. `deleteThing(id)` → delete own post or comment
2. `unsavePost(id)` → remove from saved items
3. `vote(id, dir)` → upvote/downvote/unvote

### Community management
1. `subscribe(action, sr_name)` → subscribe/unsubscribe from subreddit
2. `blockUser(account_id)` → block a user

### Check notifications
1. `getNotifications(limit)` → inbox: replies, mentions, messages

openweb reddit exec getSubredditPosts '{"subreddit": "programming"}'

# Search posts
openweb reddit exec searchPosts '{"q": "typescript"}'

# Get popular posts
openweb reddit exec getPopularPosts '{}'

# Get post with comments (post_id from a listing)
openweb reddit exec getPostComments '{"subreddit": "programming", "post_id": "1s5ja3a"}'

# Get user profile
openweb reddit exec getUserProfile '{"username": "spez"}'

# Get user's recent posts/comments
openweb reddit exec getUserPosts '{"username": "spez"}'

# Get subreddit metadata
openweb reddit exec getSubredditAbout '{"subreddit": "programming"}'

# Create a self post (requires auth)
openweb reddit exec createPost '{"sr": "test", "title": "Hello", "kind": "self", "text": "Body text"}'

# Comment on a post (requires auth)
openweb reddit exec createComment '{"thing_id": "t3_abc123", "text": "Great post!"}'

# Delete a post or comment (requires auth)
openweb reddit exec deleteThing '{"id": "t3_abc123"}'

# Subscribe to a subreddit (requires auth)
openweb reddit exec subscribe '{"action": "sub", "sr_name": "programming"}'

# Unsubscribe from a subreddit (requires auth)
openweb reddit exec subscribe '{"action": "unsub", "sr_name": "programming"}'

# Unsave a post (requires auth)
openweb reddit exec unsavePost '{"id": "t3_abc123"}'

## Site Internals

Everything below is for discover/compile operators and deep debugging.

## API Architecture
- Public read API via `www.reddit.com` — append `.json` to any Reddit URL for JSON
- Authenticated read/write ops use `oauth.reddit.com` with Bearer token
- Legacy write ops (`vote`, `savePost`) use `www.reddit.com` with cookies
- Response structure: `{data: {children: [...], after: "t3_..."}}`
- Post comments endpoint returns an array of two Listings: [0] = post data, [1] = comment tree
- Pagination via `after` cursor parameter (fullname like `t3_1s5ja3a`)

## Auth
No auth required for public read operations (7 ops). The `.json` API works without authentication.

Write operations and authenticated reads require OAuth:
- All new write ops (createPost, createComment, deleteThing, subscribe, unsavePost, blockUser) use `oauth.reddit.com`
- `getNotifications` and `getMe` require auth via `oauth.reddit.com`
- Legacy `vote` and `savePost` use `www.reddit.com` with session cookies

## Transport
Node transport — all operations work via direct HTTP fetch.

## Known Issues
- Write ops require OAuth Bearer token via oauth.reddit.com
- `getMe` returns features config instead of user profile without auth
- Rate limiting may apply for high-frequency requests
- Some subreddits may be private or quarantined (returns 403/451)
- Response size can be large (100KB+ for feeds, 200KB+ for comment threads)
- Reddit API traditionally expects `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`; JSON requestBody may need adapter
- **`createComment` fixture rot:** the `thing_id` decays once the target post is deleted, locked, or archived (Reddit auto-archives at 6 months). Refresh by sourcing a recent active thread via `openweb reddit getSubredditPosts '{"subreddit":"learnprogramming","sort":"new"}'` and pinning the freshest non-stickied `t3_*` ID. Per `feedback_hn_comment_text.md`, the comment text must be substantive and on-topic — placeholder strings like "test xxx" are removed by Reddit's spam filter without an error.
