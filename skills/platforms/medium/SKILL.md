# Medium

## Overview
Blogging and publishing platform. Content platform archetype. Search articles, browse topic feeds, discover curated lists, explore writers, clap articles, follow writers, and save bookmarks via Medium's GraphQL API.

## Workflows

### Browse articles by topic
1. `getRecommendedTags` → pick tag → `tagSlug`
2. `getTagFeed(tagSlug)` → posts with `postId`
3. `getArticle(postId)` → full article detail

### Search and read
1. `searchArticles(query)` → results with titles, URLs
2. Pick article URL → extract `postId` from URL
3. `getArticle(postId)` → full detail

### Explore writers for a topic
1. `getTagWriters(tagSlug)` → writers/publications with `userId`, bio, follower count

### Discover curated content
1. `getTagCuratedLists(tagSlug)` → staff-picked reading lists
2. Lists contain posts with `postId` → `getArticle(postId)`

### Engage with content (requires login)
1. `getTagFeed(tagSlug)` → `posts[].postId`
2. `clapArticle(postId ← posts[].postId, numClaps?)` → `clapCount`, `viewerClapCount` (numClaps 1–50, default 1)
3. `saveArticle(postId ← posts[].postId)` → `catalogItemId`
4. `unsaveArticle(postId ← posts[].postId)` → adapter resolves `postId → catalogItemId` via `getPredefinedCatalog().itemsConnection`, then issues delete

### Follow a writer (requires login)
1. `getTagWriters(tagSlug)` → writers with `userId`
2. `followWriter(userId ← getTagWriters)` → `isFollowing`
3. `unfollowWriter(userId)` → removes follow
