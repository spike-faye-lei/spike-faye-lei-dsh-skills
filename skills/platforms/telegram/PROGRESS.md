## 2026-04-24 — Userflow QA: response trimming and fixes

**Context:** Blind persona QA (crypto trader, news junkie, family member) across read ops: getChats, getMessages, searchMessages, getUserInfo, getMe, getContacts.
**Findings:**
- `getChats`: empty `title: ""` for private chats with no name, `lastMessageDate` always missing (broken data path — adapter read `chat.lastMessage.date` which TG Web A doesn't populate), self-chat showed user's name instead of "Saved Messages"
- `getMessages`/`searchMessages`: `senderName: ""` empty string leaked instead of omission for unknown senders, `chatTitle: "unknown"` for private chats
- `getUserInfo`/`getMe`/`getContacts`: undefined fields serialized (e.g. `phoneNumber: ""`, `status: undefined`) — should be omitted
- Session drops after ~2 CLI invocations: page close (owned=true) corrupts Telegram's IndexedDB session on page reopen

**Changes (adapter):**
- `getChats`: derive `lastMessageDate` from `messages.byChatId[id]` when `chat.lastMessage.date` missing; show "Saved Messages" for self-chat; add `unreadCount` from chat state; omit zero-value `membersCount`
- `getMessages`: omit `senderId`/`senderName` when absent instead of empty strings
- `searchMessages`: omit empty `chatTitle`/`senderId`/`senderName`; added `usernames` to user type for fallback resolution
- `getUserInfo`: spread-conditional pattern — only include fields with truthy values
- `getMe`: same spread-conditional cleanup
- `getContacts`: same spread-conditional cleanup; omit empty `phoneNumber`/`status`

**Changes (spec):**
- `getMe.username`: fixed schema from `oneOf: [string, integer]` → `type: [string, 'null']`
- `getChats.title`: made optional (some private chats have no identifiable title)
- `getChats.lastMessageDate`: simplified from `oneOf: [string, integer]` → `type: integer`
- `searchMessages.chatTitle`: changed to nullable
- Added `unreadCount` field to getChats schema
- `manifest.json`: corrected `operation_count` from 7 → 13

**Known issue (architecture):** Telegram session drops after ~2 CLI invocations. Root cause: `acquirePage` creates an owned page that gets closed in the finally block after each call. Page close triggers Telegram's session cleanup in IndexedDB, so subsequent calls find the session expired. This is a runtime-level issue (page ownership model) not adapter-specific — affects any SPA that stores auth in IndexedDB with cleanup-on-close handlers.

**Verification:** Fresh-browser getChats, getMessages, getUserInfo, getContacts all return clean trimmed responses with no schema warnings.

## 2026-04-20 — deleteMessage fixture chained in Saved Messages (handoff5)

**Context:** `deleteMessage` was the last unchained write op — fixture pinned `chatId: "8259810574"` (a real peer) with `messageId: "latest"`, which is fragile (peer can leave/archive) and risked deleting cross-account history. `sendMessage` had no `order:` field, so the resolver could see no outgoing messages and the op silently no-op'd or hit "no outgoing messages".
**Changes:** `sendMessage.example.json` gained `"order": 1` to seed Saved Messages first; `deleteMessage.example.json` switched `chatId` to `"me"` (resolved to `currentUserId` per `adapters/telegram-protocol.js:110`) and `"order": 7` so it runs after the existing `editMessage`/`forwardMessages`/`pinMessage`/`unpinMessage`/`markAsRead` chain. Fallback: junk account `@vdyzrisw` if Saved Messages ever gets restricted. (commit 1982640)
**Verification:** `pnpm dev verify telegram --browser --write` 12/12 PASS.
**Key discovery:** Saved Messages (`chatId: "me"`) is the canonical hermetic-fixture target for telegram writes — no shared-state pollution, no peer dependency, no risk of corrupting real chats. Combine with `messageId: "latest"` + an `order: 1` seed to make the chain self-creating.

## 2026-04-19 — Write-Verify Campaign: 4/5 PASS via outgoing-message fixture + forwardMessages adapter fix

**Context:** Prior session left telegram at 1/5 (markAsRead only). The other 4 write ops (`editMessage`, `forwardMessages`, `pinMessage`, `unpinMessage`) all failed with "no outgoing messages" because they resolve `messageId: "latest"` against `global.messages.byChatId[peerId]` filtered by `isOutgoing === true`, and the verify account's Saved Messages chat had never had an outgoing message.
**Changes:**
- Fixture-side: ran `pnpm dev telegram exec sendMessage '{"chatId":"me","text":"openweb-verify-test"}'` once to seed Saved Messages with an outgoing message. This single fixture-setup step unblocked `editMessage`, `pinMessage`, `unpinMessage` (verified PASS).
- `adapters/telegram-protocol.ts` `forwardMessages`: was passing `messages: messageIds.map(id => ({ id, chatId: peerId }))` — stub objects. `callApi('forwardMessages', ...)` requires real `ApiMessage` entities. Rewrote to look each id up in `global.messages.byChatId[peerId].byId` and pass the loaded entities; refuse if any are missing.
- Same op: added self-chat synthesis fallback for `toChat` when `toChatId === "me"`, mirroring `resolveCtx`'s existing fallback for `fromChat`. Without it, a fresh-session forward to Saved Messages throws `Chat me not found in state` because `chats.byId[currentUserId]` may be empty until the user opens that chat.
**Verification:** 4/5 PASS (`markAsRead`, `editMessage`, `pinMessage`, `unpinMessage`). `forwardMessages` adapter fix landed but live-verify was blocked: the openweb browser lifecycle restarted Chrome multiple times during retest, the source profile snapshot got wiped, and CDP repeatedly missed the logged-in tab. The fix is small, isolated, and theoretically correct; it ships unverified for a future session retest.
**Key discovery:** Telegram Web's `callApi('forwardMessages', ...)` is strict about the `messages` argument — it must be the actual hydrated `ApiMessage` from the global store, not a stub. The error surfaces as a bare `page.evaluate: Object` because the GramJS Worker rejects with a non-Error value. Whenever a write op only needs an id but the underlying API takes an entity, the adapter must hydrate via the global store before dispatch.
**Pitfalls:**
- The "send one outgoing message" prerequisite is account-shaped, not site-shaped. It's now documented in `DOC.md` § Known Issues and `SKILL.md` § Saved Messages write-verify prerequisite, so future verify campaigns on a fresh account won't re-rediscover it.
- Repeatedly retrying `verify --browser` after a CDP failure can spawn parallel Chrome instances that clobber each other's profile copies. The lifecycle treats a stale `browser.pid` as "external Chrome on port" and refuses to attach. Pause and confirm browser state with the user before retry-loops, per the global "pause before browser CDP" feedback.

**Context:** Post-`32a698a` (CustomRunner migration), all 5 write ops failed in `verify --write`. The migration commit had stripped `init()` claiming it was a "trivial webpack-ready check" — wrong. `init()` was load-bearing: it polled `webpackChunktelegram_t` chunk registration AND `getGlobal()?.currentUserId` to gate `run()` on full SPA hydration. Without it, `findGetGlobal`/`findCallApi` walked an empty webpack registry and silently returned undefined.
**Changes:**
- Commit `cedf7db`: restored the SPA-readiness gate at the top of `run()` as `page.waitForFunction` polling for `(webpackChunktelegram_t || webpackChunkwebk).length > 0` AND `getGlobal()?.currentUserId !== undefined`. Adapter is now resilient to fast-restart races and fresh-profile boots.
- Commit `defc044`: dispatched `actions.openChat({ id: getGlobal().currentUserId })` on every `run()` to prime the GramJS Worker's entity cache for Saved Messages. Without this, callApi mutations targeting `chatId: "me"` race against an empty Worker cache.
- Server URL switched from bare `web.telegram.org` to `web.telegram.org/a/` (the Web A path the adapter targets).
**Verification:** 1/5 PASS — `markAsRead`. The other 4 (`editMessage`, `forwardMessages`, `pinMessage`, `unpinMessage`) fail with "no outgoing messages" because the test account's Saved Messages chat has no outgoing message for `messageId: "latest"` to resolve to. **User action:** send any text to Saved Messages once, then re-verify.
**Key discovery:** A `CustomRunner` migration that drops `init()` for an SPA-style site is almost always wrong. Even a "trivial" precheck may be the only thing waiting for hydration. The general lesson is captured in `skills/openweb/knowledge/extraction.md` § SPA Hydration Gate.
**Pitfalls:** The migration tested as 5/5 PASS at the time because verify did not exercise write ops by default until the `--write` campaign. CustomRunner migrations should be re-verified with `--write` before landing.

## 2026-04-17 — Adapter Refactor

**Context:** Phase 5C normalize-adapter sweep — migrate site adapters off the legacy `CodeAdapter` interface (`init` / `isAuthenticated` / `execute`) onto the simpler `CustomRunner` shape (`run(ctx)`).
**Changes:**
- `adapters/telegram-protocol.ts`: `CodeAdapter` → `CustomRunner`; 459 → 425 lines.
- Dropped trivial `init()` webpack-ready check; preserved the "Many logins" conflict detection inline in `run()` preamble — throws `helpers.errors.fatal(...)` with an explicit message instead of failing silently downstream.
- Dropped `isAuthenticated()` (only inspected `getGlobal()?.currentUserId` from local state with no server probe; ops needing `currentUserId` already throw "Not authenticated" inline).
- Migrated param-validation throws from `makeError('...', 'fatal')` to `helpers.errors.missingParam(name)` for uniform classification.
**Verification:** 5/5 ops PASS.
**Key files:** `src/sites/telegram/adapters/telegram-protocol.ts`
**Commit:** 32a698a

## 2026-04-10: v3.0 — callApi writes + 6 new operations (13 total)

**What changed:**
- Rewrote all write ops from DOM manipulation to `callApi()` (GramJS Web Worker)
- sendMessage: DOM keyboard → `callApi('sendMessage', {chat, text})`
- deleteMessage: DOM right-click context menu → `callApi('deleteMessages', {chat, messageIds})`
- Added 6 new operations: getContacts, editMessage, forwardMessages, pinMessage, unpinMessage, markAsRead
- Extracted shared `resolveCtx()` helper for chatId resolution (me, +phone, raw ID)
- Added `findCallApi()` webpack scanner — locates callApi by "callMethod"+"cancelApiProgress" string constants
- deleteMessage now supports `messageId: "latest"` (resolves to most recent outgoing from state)

**Why:**
- DOM-based writes were fragile (depended on CSS selectors, context menus, confirm dialogs)
- callApi goes directly to GramJS Worker → MTProto, completely bypassing the DOM
- Architecture: reads via getGlobal (webpack state), writes via callApi (GramJS Worker)

**Verification:** 7/7 ops PASS in `verify --write --browser`, new ops exec-tested individually
**Commit:** pending

## 2026-04-10: v2.1 — fixed sendMessage + deleteMessage DOM approach

**What changed:**
- sendMessage: added chat navigation (sidebar click + search fallback)
- deleteMessage: fixed DOM selectors, added modal dismissal, chat navigation
- Discovered TG Web A ignores post-boot hash changes — sidebar click is the only reliable navigation
- Fixed chatId resolution to not treat numeric IDs as phone numbers

**Why:**
- Both write ops failed in verify — sendMessage didn't navigate to chat, deleteMessage used stale selectors

**Verification:** 6/7 PASS (getChats DRIFT on membersCount)

## 2026-04-01: v2.0 — expanded to 7 operations

**What changed:**
- Expanded from 3 to 7 operations: getChats, getMessages, searchMessages, getUserInfo, getMe, sendMessage, deleteMessage
- Renamed getDialogs → getChats for consistency
- Added richer response fields: senderName, isOutgoing, membersCount, lastMessageDate

**Why:**
- Prior package only had basic read operations; messaging archetype expects search, contacts, and write operations

**Verification:** adapter-level (requires logged-in browser session)
