Travel review and booking platform. Archetype: Travel. Adapter-only site — all data extracted from LD+JSON structured data and DOM on SSR pages.

## Workflows

### Search hotels in a city

2. `searchHotels(geoId, location)` → hotel list with names, ratings, addresses

### Get hotel detail
1. `searchLocation(query)` → `geoId`
2. `searchHotels(geoId, location)` → pick hotel → extract `locationId` and `slug` from URL
3. `getHotelDetail(geoId, locationId, slug)` → name, rating, amenities, star rating, price range, check-in/out

### Search restaurants in a city
1. `searchLocation(query)` → pick location → `geoId`, `locationSlug`
2. `searchRestaurants(geoId, location)` → restaurant list with names, ratings, cuisine, price range

### Get restaurant detail

### Get attraction detail
1. `searchLocation(query)` → `geoId`
