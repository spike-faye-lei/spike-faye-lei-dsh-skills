# Trello

## Overview

Kanban board task management. Productivity/collaboration archetype.

## Workflows

### Browse boards and cards

1. `getBoards` → `boards[].id`
2. `getBoard boardId` ← boards[].id → full board with `lists[]` and `cards[]`
3. `getCards listId` ← lists[].id → cards in a specific list

### Create a card

1. `getBoards` → pick a board
2. `getLists boardId` ← boards[].id → `lists[].id`
3. `createCard idList, name` ← lists[].id → new card

### Archive or delete a card

1. `getBoard boardId` or `getCards listId` → `cards[].id`
2. `archiveCard cardId` ← cards[].id → soft-close (reversible in Trello UI)
3. `deleteCard cardId` ← cards[].id → permanent deletion (irreversible)

## Operations

| Operation | Intent | Key Input | Key Output | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-----------|------------|-------|
| getBoards | read | — (entry point) | boards[].id, name, url | Lists user's open boards |
| getBoard | read | boardId ← getBoards | lists[], cards[] with labels/due | Full board snapshot |
| getLists | read | boardId ← getBoards | lists[].id, name, pos | Open lists only |
| getCards | read | listId ← getLists/getBoard | cards[].id, name, due, labels | Cards in one list |
| createCard | write | idList ← getLists, name | card.id, url | Creates a card |
| deleteCard | write | cardId ← getCards/getBoard | deleted: true | Permanent delete (caution) |
| archiveCard | write | cardId ← getCards/getBoard | closed: true | Soft-close, reversible |

## Quick Start

```bash
# List your boards
openweb trello exec getBoards '{}'

# Get a board with all lists and cards
openweb trello exec getBoard '{"boardId": "BOARD_ID"}'

# Get cards in a list
openweb trello exec getCards '{"listId": "LIST_ID"}'

# Create a card
openweb trello exec createCard '{"idList": "LIST_ID", "name": "My task", "desc": "Details here"}'

# Archive a card (soft-delete)
openweb trello exec archiveCard '{"cardId": "CARD_ID"}'

# Delete a card permanently
openweb trello exec deleteCard '{"cardId": "CARD_ID"}'
```

## Site Internals

- **API Architecture:** REST API at `trello.com/1/` (same-origin proxy). All operations are standard REST endpoints with JSON responses. Note: `api.trello.com` is blocked by CORS when called from `trello.com` page context.
- **Auth:** Cookie session from trello.com webapp. Session cookies authenticate API calls via same-origin proxy.
- **Transport:** `page` — browser context required for cookie-authenticated API calls. All operations use an adapter that calls the API via `pageFetch`.
- **Adapter:** `trello-api` — translates operation params to Trello REST API calls. Uses `helpers.pageFetch()` for browser-context requests with cookie auth.

## Adapter Patterns

- **Shape:** `CustomRunner` with a single `run(ctx)` entrypoint (`ctx.op`, `ctx.params`, `ctx.prepared`, `ctx.helpers`). The local `CodeAdapter` shim was removed in favor of importing `CustomRunner`, `PreparedContext`, and `AdapterHelpers` from shared types.
- `init()` and `isAuthenticated()` were dropped: the URL check was trivial and the cookie substring check was not a real server probe — the runtime's auth cascade handles both.

## Known Issues

- All operations require authentication. Run `openweb login trello` first.
- Board/list/card IDs are opaque strings — always obtain from a prior operation.
- `createCard`, `deleteCard`, and `archiveCard` are write operations with `safety: caution` — they modify real data in the user's workspace.
- `deleteCard` is irreversible. Prefer `archiveCard` for recoverable removal.
- **Test-card pattern for write-op fixtures:** `archiveCard` / `deleteCard` examples must reference a real card ID — placeholders return HTTP 400. Maintain a dedicated test card in a personal board (current convention: a card named `openweb-verify-archiveCard-fixture` in the user's "Hour of AI" board) and refresh the fixture's `cardId` whenever the card is purged. Archive is reversible from the Trello UI, so the same card can be re-used across runs by un-archiving between verifications.
