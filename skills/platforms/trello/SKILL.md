# Trello

## Overview

Kanban board task management. Productivity/collaboration archetype.

## Workflows

### Browse boards and cards

1. `getBoards` → `boards[].id`
2. `getBoard boardId` ← boards[].id → full board with `lists[]` and `cards[]`
3. `getCards listId` ← lists[].id → cards in a specific list

### Create a card

1. `getBoards` → pick a board
2. `getLists boardId` ← boards[].id → `lists[].id`
3. `createCard idList, name` ← lists[].id → new card

### Archive or delete a card

1. `getBoard boardId` or `getCards listId` → `cards[].id`
2. `archiveCard cardId` ← cards[].id → soft-close (reversible in Trello UI)
3. `deleteCard cardId` ← cards[].id → permanent deletion (irreversible)
