# Steam Store

## Overview
Gaming marketplace. Game search, details, pricing, user reviews, news, player counts, and achievements via Steam's public APIs.

## Workflows

### Find and research a game
1. `searchGames(term)` → pick game → `id`
2. `getAppDetails(appids=id)` → full info, price, genres, metacritic
3. `getAppReviews(appid=id)` → user reviews, score summary

### Track a game's community
1. `searchGames(term)` → `id`
2. `getAppNews(appid=id)` → news articles
3. `getCurrentPlayers(appid=id)` → live player count
4. `getGlobalAchievements(gameid=id)` → achievement unlock rates

### Browse deals and new releases
1. `getFeatured()` → promoted games with discounts
2. `getFeaturedCategories()` → specials, top sellers, new releases, coming soon
3. `getAppDetails(appids=id)` → drill into any game

### Explore DLC and bundles
1. `getAppDetails(appids=id)` → find package IDs from game info
2. `getDlcForApp(appid=id)` → list all DLC for a game
3. `getPackageDetails(packageids=id)` → bundle contents and pricing

## Site Internals

## API Architecture
- **Two API hosts**: `store.steampowered.com` (store APIs) and `api.steampowered.com` (Steamworks Web API)
- Store APIs: `/api/appdetails`, `/api/storesearch/`, `/api/featured/`, `/api/featuredcategories/`, `/api/packagedetails`, `/appreviews/{appid}`, `/api/dlcforapp/`, `/tagdata/populartags/english`
- Steamworks APIs: ISteamNews, ISteamUserStats interfaces with versioned methods
- All operations are public (no API key required)

## Auth
No auth required. `requires_auth: false`.

## Transport
`transport: node` — direct HTTP fetch. No bot detection on API endpoints.

## Known Issues
- **appdetails rate limiting** — Steam may rate-limit rapid appdetails requests; space out bulk lookups
- **Package IDs** — not easily discoverable; use appdetails to find package IDs from a known app
- **Regional pricing** — use `cc` parameter for correct local pricing; defaults to US
- **Free games** — `is_free: true` games have no `price_overview` field in appdetails
- **Age-gated content** — some appdetails may return `success: false` for age-restricted apps without cookies
- **getDlcForApp, getPopularTags** — unverified; working in manual testing but not yet in verify fingerprint
