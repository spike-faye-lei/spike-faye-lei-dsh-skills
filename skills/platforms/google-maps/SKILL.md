# Google Maps

## Overview

Google Maps — location search, place details, directions, and geocoding. Adapter-based extraction from internal APIs and SPA DOM.

## Workflows

### Find a place and get details

1. `searchPlaces(query)` → `placeId`, name, address, rating
2. `getPlaceDetails(placeId)` → name, address, rating, hours, website, phone, reviews
3. `getPlaceReviews(placeId)` → reviews with author, rating, relative time
4. `getPlacePhotos(placeId)` → photo URLs with dimensions
5. `getPlaceHours(placeId)` → weekly operating schedule
6. `getPlaceAbout(placeId)` → description, category, attributes

Steps 2–6 all use `placeId` from step 1.

### Search nearby and compare

1. `nearbySearch(category, location)` → `placeId`, name, address, rating
2. `getPlaceDetails(placeId)` per result → compare ratings, hours, prices

### Get directions between locations

- `getDirections(origin, destination)` → driving routes with distance, duration
- `getTransitDirections(origin, destination)` → public transit routes
- `getWalkingDirections(origin, destination)` → walking routes
- `getBicyclingDirections(origin, destination)` → cycling routes

All are entry points — pick the travel mode needed.

### Geocoding

- `geocode(address)` → `lat`, `lng`, `placeId` from address string
- `reverseGeocode(lat, lng)` → address, place name from coordinates

## Quick Start

```bash
# Search for places
openweb google-maps exec searchPlaces '{"query": "coffee shops in San Francisco"}'

# Get place details (use placeId from search results)
openweb google-maps exec getPlaceDetails '{"placeId": "0x80858135f0db680b:0x47e714bf5f0080a3", "query": "The Coffee Berry SF"}'

# Get driving directions
openweb google-maps exec getDirections '{"origin": "San Francisco, CA", "destination": "Los Angeles, CA"}'

# Get transit directions
openweb google-maps exec getTransitDirections '{"origin": "Union Square, San Francisco", "destination": "Golden Gate Park, San Francisco"}'

# Search nearby
openweb google-maps exec nearbySearch '{"category": "restaurants", "location": "Times Square"}'

# Geocode an address
openweb google-maps exec geocode '{"address": "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA"}'

# Reverse geocode coordinates
openweb google-maps exec reverseGeocode '{"lat": 37.7749, "lng": -122.4194}'
```
