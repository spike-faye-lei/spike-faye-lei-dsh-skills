# Quora — Internals

## API Architecture
- GraphQL API at `https://www.quora.com/graphql/gql_para_POST` with persisted query hashes
- Persisted queries use `extensions.hash` (deployment-scoped, rotate on deploys)
- Page-scoped `quora-formkey` header acts as CSRF token (extracted from script tags)
- Initial page data delivered via SSR; GraphQL used for pagination/dynamic content
- GQL responses use multipart format (`--qgqlmpb` boundary)

## Auth
- No auth required for public reads
- Session cookies: `m-b`, `m-s`, `m-login`, `m-lat`, `m-uid`
- `quora-formkey` embedded in script tags (page-scoped, cannot replay from Node)

## Transport
- **page** transport with adapter — formkey is page-scoped, direct GraphQL replay returns null data
- **getQuestion / getAnswers**: Tier 4 (GQL intercept) — intercepts `QuestionPagedListPaginationQuery` response during page navigation for structured data (author, upvotes, views, timestamps). Falls back to Tier 5 (page.evaluate(fetch)) for pagination using captured hash + formkey. DOM extraction (Tier 2) as final fallback when GQL pagination query doesn't fire (questions with few answers).
- **searchQuestions**: Tier 2 (DOM extraction) — search results are SSR-rendered; no separate GQL query exists for search. A fresh page is opened to avoid stale state from the warm-up page.
- **getProfile**: Tier 2 (DOM extraction) — no GQL profile query available; profile data only in DOM. Opens a fresh page to avoid CORP-blocked navigation.

## GQL Query Discovery
- `QuestionPagedListPaginationQuery` — returns paginated answers with structured data: `answer.content` (JSON rich text), `answer.author.names[]`, `answer.numUpvotes`, `answer.numViews`, `answer.creationTime`, `answer.authorCredential`
- Relay-style node IDs: `base64("Question@0:{qid}")` — qid extracted from GQL response
- Hash extracted from intercepted requests; used for Tier 5 pagination calls
- Search page: only `facebookAutoLogin_Query` (not useful); search data is SSR
- Profile page: only `UserProfileSpacesSection_Paging_Query` (spaces, not profile data)

## Known Issues
- Profile pages return ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE when navigated from an existing page (CORP/COEP headers); mitigated by opening a fresh page per request
- Quora content fields are JSON-encoded rich text (`{"sections":[{"spans":[{"text":"..."}]}]}`) — adapter parses to plain text
- GQL pagination query only fires for questions with enough answers to paginate; fewer-answer questions fall back to DOM extraction
- DOM-extracted answer counts may be inaccurate (regex matches noise in page text)
- DOM selectors may change on frontend deploys
