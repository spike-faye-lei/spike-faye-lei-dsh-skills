# X (Twitter)

## Overview
Social media and microblogging platform. Archetype: Social Media. GraphQL API with persisted query hashes, L3 adapter for dynamic hash resolution and request signing. REST v1.1/v2 endpoints for social graph and moderation actions.

## Workflows

### Browse timeline and interact
1. `getHomeTimeline` → tweets → `tweet_id`
2. `likeTweet(tweet_id)` / `createBookmark(tweet_id)` / `createRetweet(tweet_id)`

### Compose and manage tweets
1. `createTweet(text)` → `rest_id` (new tweet_id)
2. `reply(tweet_id, text)` → reply to a tweet → `rest_id`
3. `deleteTweet(tweet_id)` → delete your own tweet (tweet_id from createTweet `rest_id` or getHomeTimeline)

### Find and read a user's profile
1. `getUserByScreenName(screen_name)` → `rest_id` (userId), `name`, `followers_count`
2. `getUserTweets(userId)` → user's tweets → `tweet_id`
3. `getUserLikes(userId)` → user's liked tweets → `tweet_id`
4. `getUserFollowers(userId)` / `getUserFollowing(userId)` → follower/following `rest_id` list

### Manage social graph
1. `getUserByScreenName(screen_name)` → `rest_id`
2. `followUser(userId)` / `unfollowUser(userId)`
3. `blockUser(userId)` / `unblockUser(userId)`
4. `muteUser(userId)` / `unmuteUser(userId)`

### Search tweets
1. `searchTweets(rawQuery)` → tweet results with cursor pagination

### Get tweet with replies
1. `getTweetDetail(focalTweetId)` → full tweet thread with replies

### Moderate replies
1. `getTweetDetail(focalTweetId)` → reply entries → reply `tweet_id`
2. `hideReply(tweet_id)` / `unhideReply(tweet_id)` — hide/show replies on your tweets

### Direct messages
1. `getUserByScreenName(screen_name)` → `rest_id` (recipientId)
2. `sendDM(recipientId, text)` → DM event with `messageId` — approved contacts only

### Notifications and bookmarks
1. `getNotifications` → mentions, likes, retweets, follows
2. `getBookmarks` → your bookmarked tweets

### Trending / Explore
1. `getExplorePage` → trending topics, recommended content

## Quick Start

```bash
# Get home timeline
openweb x exec getHomeTimeline '{"count": 20}'

# Search tweets
openweb x exec searchTweets '{"rawQuery": "openai", "count": 20, "product": "Latest"}'

# Get user profile
openweb x exec getUserByScreenName '{"screen_name": "openai"}'

# Get tweet detail (also serves as getThread)
openweb x exec getTweetDetail '{"focalTweetId": "1234567890"}'

# Get user's followers (need userId from getUserByScreenName → rest_id)
openweb x exec getUserFollowers '{"userId": "4398626122", "count": 20}'

# Create a tweet
openweb x exec createTweet '{"text": "Hello from OpenWeb!"}'

# Reply to a tweet
openweb x exec reply '{"tweet_id": "1234567890", "text": "Great thread!"}'

# Follow a user
openweb x exec followUser '{"userId": "4398626122"}'

# Send a DM (approved contacts only)
openweb x exec sendDM '{"recipientId": "4398626122", "text": "Hey!"}'

# Get notifications
openweb x exec getNotifications '{"count": 20}'

```

## Known Limitations

- **Open `https://x.com/home` in the managed Chrome (port 9222) before running write ops.** The site declares `page_plan.entry_url=https://x.com/home` with `warm: true`, but a runtime cascade can leave verify holding a stale browser handle if no x.com tab is already open at start. Pre-warming the tab also ensures cookies, ct0 CSRF, and the webpack signing module are hydrated.
- **Never use your own userId as a follow/block/mute target.** Twitter returns 403 (`code 158/147/271 — "you can't <verb> yourself"`) which the runtime maps to `needs_login`, triggering a 45 s cascade-timeout per op. Use a stable third-party account (e.g. `@XDevelopers` id `2244994945`) for testing. Destroy variants (unfollow/unblock/unmute) return 200 no-op even on self, masking the issue if you only check those.
- **`hideReply` / `unhideReply` require a cross-account reply.** Twitter blocks moderating own replies on own thread (returns DRIFT — `tweet_moderate_put: Done` only fires for foreign replies). The pinned fixture id `2046061970021847164` is a reply by `@QGuo219895` on `@iamoonkey/2045749343437619246` — both fixtures hard-code this id; `unhideReply` chains via `order: 19` after `hideReply`'s `order: 18`. The transport is GraphQL `ModerateTweet` / `UnmoderateTweet` (NOT the legacy REST `PUT /i/api/2/tweets/{id}/hidden`, which has been removed and hangs 45 s). No re-seeding needed between runs as long as the parent reply isn't deleted by the alt account.
- **Verified write ops:** `likeTweet`, `unlikeTweet`, `createBookmark`, `deleteBookmark`, `createRetweet`, `deleteRetweet`, `unblockUser`, `unfollowUser`, plus all 6 user/reply ops in standalone `pnpm dev x exec` runs after the 2026-04-19 fixture refresh. Aggregate `verify --write` still loses the create-side ops to cascade churn — see DOC.md "Verify quirk".
